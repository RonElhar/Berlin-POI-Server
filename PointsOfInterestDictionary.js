    description: "The Museum of Natural History in Berlin offers you an exciting insight into the natural world. Follow the development of life on our planet, and discover how different forms of life evolve. Be astonished by prehistoric animals, birds and the legendary polar bear Knut. Or look back into the genesis of the universe. One highlight is encountering the world''s largest dinosaur skeleton, a colossal 13.27 metre tall Brachiosaurus. Even more spectacular is Tristan Otto, a gigantic Tyrannosaurus Rex. In the special exhibition Tristan - Berlin bares teeth, you encounter a 66 million-year-old and 12 metre long dinosaur skeleton, one of the best preserved specimens in the world. The skull alone, with its fearsome teeth, measures 1.5 metres. But there are many more exciting exhibits, so you''ll want to take your time when exploring",
